# Contributing

All contributions are welcome, including typo fixes.
There might be a few `TODO` comments marking future intentions;
feel free to work on those as well.

See _[Code style][1]_ and _[Project structure][2]_
for more information on the project itself.


## Run tests

Whenever you make a <em>fix</em>, run the tests with `pytest`:

```shell
$ pytest
```

If everything passes, you are good to go.
